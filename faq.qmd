## *What areas of town should we look into?*

The wedding party will be staying in Pozos Colorado. It is a quieter beachfront area with beautiful views, plenty of hotel options, and a more peaceful vibe. It is also ~10-15 minutes away from the airport, the wedding vanue, and downtown Santa Marta. Other options –

<br>

Centro Histórico (~30 minutes from the airport). It’s busier and farther from the beach, but walkable.

<br>

El Rodadero (~25 minutes from the airport) is lively and full of restaurants and nightlife although it can be very touristy.
