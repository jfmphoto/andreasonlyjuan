## *What airport should I fly into? Are there other options?*


 
Santa Marta’s international airport is Simón Bolívar International Airport (SMR).

There aren’t any direct flights from the US, but there are one stop flights departing from the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale or New York area. 

Alternatively, guests can fly directly to Barranquilla and take a two hour shuttle from Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (BAQ) to Santa Marta (SMR). The public shuttle can be around $8-$15 USD per person.

## *What areas of town should we look into?*

 

The wedding party will be staying in the Bello Horizonte area. It is a quieter beachfront area with beautiful views, plenty of hotel options, and a more peaceful vibe. It is also ~10-15 minutes away from the airport.
<br><br>
Other areas - 
Centro Histórico neighborhood (~30 minutes from the airport). It’s busier and farther from the beach, but walkable. 

El Rodadero is another popular area (~25 minutes from the airport). It is lively and full of restaurants and nightlife although it can be very touristy. 

You really can’t go wrong in Santa Marta, it all depends on what you’re looking for.
